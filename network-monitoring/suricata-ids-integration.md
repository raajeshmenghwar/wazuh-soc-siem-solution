# Suricata Integration with Wazuh SIEM

## Overview

**[Suricata](https://suricata.io/)** is a high-performance, open-source network threat detection engine developed by the [Open Information Security Foundation (OISF)](https://oisf.net). It functions as:

* **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**
* **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**
* **NSM (Network Security Monitoring) tool**

It analyzes network traffic using deep packet inspection (DPI), pattern matching, and protocol analysis, powered by customizable rule sets.


## Suricata vs Other Network Monitoring Tools

[Suricata](https://suricata.io/) is a modern, high-performance engine that acts as an IDS, IPS, and Network Security Monitoring (NSM) tool. It supports multithreading, deep packet inspection, and is designed for scalability and speed.

[Snort](https://snort.org/) is a widely used IDS/IPS focused on real-time traffic analysis and packet logging. While robust and mature, it is single-threaded, which can limit performance on multi-core systems.

[Zeek](https://zeek.org/) (formerly Bro) is primarily a network security monitoring platform. It excels at protocol analysis and behavioral monitoring, providing rich context and scripting capabilities for advanced network visibility.

## Why Use Suricata with Wazuh?

| Feature                  | Suricata Role                            | Wazuh Role                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Network Threat Detection | Analyzes traffic and detects anomalies   | Collects and normalizes Suricata logs        |
| Alert Correlation        | Matches traffic with threat intelligence | Aggregates alerts, enriches context          |
| Visibility               | Monitors gateway and server traffic      | Displays findings in a centralized dashboard |

Wazuh integrates Suricata logs into its platform for better correlation, centralized alerting, and event analysis.

## Where Should Suricata Be Installed?
Install Suricata on:

    - Wazuh Manager — to monitor incoming/outgoing traffic and protect your SIEM backend.
    - Perimeter Servers / Web Servers / Bastion Hosts / DMZ nodes — where network visibility is crucial and threats are more likely to hit.

Not needed on:
    - Normal endpoints (desktops, workstations) — unless:
    - You're running high-risk apps/services on them
    - You need deep traffic analysis at the host level
    - You have plenty of resources to manage and analyze network data from each endpoin

Suricata is not meant to be installed on every endpoint. Deploy it at strategic points where network visibility matters.

---

## Step 1: Install Suricata on Ubuntu

### 1.1 Add the Official PPA and Install

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install suricata -y
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
suricata -V
# Output: Suricata version 8.0.0 RELEASE (or similar)
```

---

## Step 2: Download and Configure Rules

### 2.1 What Are Emerging Threats Rules?

[Emerging Threats (ET)](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/) provides free, community-maintained IDS/IPS rules compatible with Suricata.

### 2.2 Download and Install ET Rules

```bash
cd /tmp/
curl -LO https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-6.0.8/emerging.rules.tar.gz
tar -xvzf emerging.rules.tar.gz
sudo mkdir -p /etc/suricata/rules
sudo mv rules/*.rules /etc/suricata/rules/
sudo chmod 640 /etc/suricata/rules/*.rules
```

---

## Step 3: Configure `suricata.yaml`

Edit the main configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

### 3.1 Define Network Variables

Find and modify the following:

```yaml
HOME_NET: "<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>"   # Replace with your server’s IP
# EXTERNAL_NET: "!$HOME_NET"    # Comment it
EXTERNAL_NET: "any"             # Un-comment it
```

To find your IP:

```bash
ip a
```

### 3.2 Configure Network Interface

Search for `af-packet` section and update the `interface`:

```yaml
af-packet:
  - interface: ens33  # Replace with your actual network interface
```

To find your interface:

```bash
ip link show
```

### 3.3 Set Rule Paths

Set the correct rules path and pattern:

```yaml
default-rule-path: /etc/suricata/rules

rule-files:
  - "*.rules"
```

This ensures all `*.rules` files in the directory are loaded.

Save and close the file.

### 3.4 Restart Suricata

```bash
sudo systemctl restart suricata
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status suricata
```

---

## Step 4: Integrate Suricata with Wazuh

### 4.1 Log Output from Suricata

Suricata logs traffic events to:

```bash
/var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

### 4.2 Configure Wazuh to Monitor Suricata Logs

Edit the Wazuh configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```

Add the following inside `<ossec_config>`:

```xml
<localfile>
  <log_format>json</log_format>
  <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location>
</localfile>
```

### 4.3 Restart Wazuh Manager

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

Verify services:

```bash
sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager wazuh-dashboard wazuh-indexer
```

---

## Step 5: Simulate a Network Attack

On Kali Linux or another attacking machine:

```bash
nmap -sS -T4 <TARGET-IP>
```

| Flag  | Purpose            |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| `-sS` | SYN Scan (stealth) |
| `-T4` | Faster timing      |

This scan should trigger detection alerts in Suricata.

---

## Step 6: View Alerts in Wazuh Dashboard

1. Log in to the Wazuh Dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Security Events**.
3. Select the appropriate agent (where Suricata is installed).
4. Filter by **Rule Group: Suricata**.

Example alert:

```
ET SCAN Nmap Synchronous Scan
```

This confirms that Wazuh is properly ingesting Suricata alerts.

---

## Monitoring Logs via CLI

View Suricata logs:

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

View JSON alerts:

```bash
jq '.' /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                     | Possible Cause                 | Solution                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| No logs in `eve.json`       | Suricata not detecting traffic | Check interface, network rules, permissions   |
| `Permission denied` in logs | Suricata can't read rules      | Fix file permissions on `/etc/suricata/rules` |
| `No rules were loaded`      | Incorrect path or rule-files   | Check `default-rule-path` and `*.rules`       |
| Service won’t start         | YAML syntax or invalid config  | Validate `suricata.yaml` using `suricata -T`  |

---

## Temporarily Stop Suricata

If you need to pause logging:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop suricata
sudo systemctl disable suricata  # Prevent on reboot
```

To resume:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable suricata
sudo systemctl start suricata
```

---

## Summary

* Suricata is a powerful IDS/IPS that integrates seamlessly with Wazuh.
* Rules are critical—without them, Suricata provides no detection.
* The Emerging Threats rule set offers a great baseline.
* Logs are ingested via the `eve.json` file using Wazuh’s `<localfile>` configuration.
* Use the Wazuh Dashboard for easy visibility and alert triage.
