# Advanced Customizations and Branding Persistence

To keep branding changes intact during upgrades and further customize the experience, follow these best practices.

## 1. Preserve Changes Across Updates

Wazuh and OpenSearch updates may overwrite UI files. To avoid this:

- Keep a copy of modified assets in a separate backup directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /opt/wazuh-dashboard-backups/assets
  cp -r /usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/src/core/server/core_app/assets/* /opt/wazuh-dashboard-backups/assets/
````

* After upgrades, reapply changes or automate restoration using scripts.
