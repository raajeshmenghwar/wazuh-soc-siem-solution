## **Why No More Separate Kibana/Elasticsearch?**

Wazuh 4.x+ ships with its **own indexer and dashboard**, removing the need to manually install or configure Elasticsearch and Kibana. This ensures:

* Simplified deployment
* Reduced compatibility issues
* Unified maintenance and support

| Feature/Component | Pre-4.x (ELK Stack)        | Post-4.x (Integrated Stack)   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Indexing          | Elasticsearch (manual)     | Wazuh Indexer (bundled)       |
| Dashboard UI      | Kibana (manual)            | Wazuh Dashboard (bundled)     |
| Deployment        | Complex (multiple systems) | Simplified (single script)    |
| Updates           | Separate per component     | Unified update management     |
| Support Scope     | Partial                    | Full (end-to-end Wazuh stack) |
