# Integrating Wazuh with TheHive and Cortex ‚Äî Beginner-Friendly Guide

## Objective

This guide will walk you through **integrating Wazuh (log detection)** with **TheHive (incident management)** and **Cortex (analysis engine)** to create a small but powerful SOC (Security Operations Center) setup.  
We‚Äôll explain the role of each tool, provide real-world scenarios, and guide you step-by-step through installation and configuration ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre setting up a **home lab** or deploying in a **production SOC**.

## 1. Understanding the Role of Each Component in a SOC Environment

Think of your SOC as a **security team for your digital property**.  

- **Wazuh** ‚Üí *Security Camera System*  
  Watches your network and systems, collecting logs and alerting you to suspicious activities (intrusion detection).

- **TheHive** ‚Üí *Control Room*  
  Where security analysts manage, track, and investigate alerts (incident management).

- **Cortex** ‚Üí *Forensics Lab*  
  Takes raw evidence (IP addresses, files, URLs) and runs analysis to give context and enrichment.

### How They Work Together
1. **Detection**: Wazuh spots suspicious activity (e.g., unusual login attempt).  
2. **Case Creation**: Wazuh sends alert ‚Üí TheHive automatically creates an incident case.  
3. **Enrichment**: TheHive sends suspicious details to Cortex for deeper analysis.  
4. **Investigation**: Analyst reviews enriched results and determines next steps.  
5. **Resolution**: Threat is contained and documented.

## 2. Real-World SOC Example Scenario

**Scenario:**  
- **Event**: A suspicious login is detected on a company server.  
- **Wazuh**: Triggers an alert with the source IP address.  
- **TheHive**: Automatically creates a case titled ‚ÄúSuspicious Login Attempt‚Äù.  
- **Cortex**: Runs an IP reputation check and finds that the IP is linked to known brute-force attacks.  
- **Analyst**: Uses this info to block the IP at the firewall and document the incident.

In a **home lab**, this might mean detecting a login attempt to your personal VM.  
In a **real SOC**, it could mean protecting thousands of employee accounts.

## 3. Beginner-Friendly Explanations of Each Technology

### Wazuh Manager
A **security monitoring tool** that collects logs from endpoints, detects anomalies, and triggers alerts.

### TheHive
An **incident response platform** where you create, manage, and track cases.

### Cortex
An **analysis engine** with "analyzers" (tools) for IP lookup, file hash analysis, malware scanning, etc.

### Docker
A platform that runs software in **isolated containers** so it‚Äôs easy to deploy without worrying about dependencies.

### Docker Compose
A tool to define and run multiple Docker containers with a single YAML file.

### REST API Basics
APIs let programs talk to each other.  
Wazuh ‚Üí TheHive integration works via API calls ‚Äî Wazuh sends JSON data to TheHive‚Äôs REST API to create cases.

## 4. Installation & Deployment Methods

You can deploy in several ways depending on your resources:

### Option 1 ‚Äî VMware (Local Lab)
- **Recommended Specs**:  
  - CPU: 4 cores  
  - RAM: 8 GB (12 GB preferred)  
  - Disk: 50 GB+  
- Install Ubuntu/Debian VM and run Docker inside it.

### Option 2 ‚Äî Docker/Docker Compose in Existing VM
- Quickest method for labs.
- Lightweight for testing.

### Option 3 ‚Äî VPS Server
- Choose a provider that supports Docker.
- Minimum specs: 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM, SSD storage.

### Option 4 ‚Äî Azure VM (Using Credits)
- Use **Azure free credits** to test SOC setup.
- Recommended: Standard B2s or higher for performance.

## 5. Step-by-Step Integration

### Step 1 ‚Äî Install Wazuh
```bash
docker network create wazuh-net
docker run -d --name wazuh-manager --network wazuh-net -p 55000:55000 -p 1514:1514/udp wazuh/wazuh
````

**Why?**
This is like installing your security cameras ‚Äî without it, nothing is being monitored.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äî Install TheHive

```yaml
# docker-compose-thehive.yml
version: '3.7'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.17.24
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms1g -Xmx1g
    ulimits:
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"

  thehive:
    image: strangebee/thehive:latest
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
```

**Why?**
TheHive is your control room ‚Äî you need it to receive and manage alerts.

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî Install Cortex

```yaml
# docker-compose-cortex.yml
version: '3.7'
services:
  cortex:
    image: strangebee/cortex:latest
    ports:
      - "9001:9001"
```

**Why?**
Cortex is your forensics lab ‚Äî it investigates data sent from TheHive.

---

### Step 4 ‚Äî Configure Wazuh ‚Üí TheHive

Edit Wazuh‚Äôs `ossec.conf`:

```xml
<integration>
  <name>thehive</name>
  <hook_url>http://THEHIVE_SERVER:9000/api/alert</hook_url>
  <api_key>YOUR_THEHIVE_API_KEY</api_key>
</integration>
```

**Scenario**: This is like telling your security cameras where to send footage.

---

### Step 5 ‚Äî Configure TheHive ‚Üí Cortex

In TheHive UI:

* Go to **Admin ‚Üí Cortex Configuration**.
* Add Cortex server URL: `http://cortex:9001`.
* Add API key from Cortex.
